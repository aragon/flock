### Open Work Labs, Partner Organization
We partnered with [Open Work Labs](https://www.openworklabs.com/) - a peer-to-peer dev studio - on AGP-19. We plan to continue working with them and have budgeted 80 hours a week (2 FT equivalents) at the same rate as the last grant. This arrangement provides us with flexibility - we can rely on Open Work Labs to complete specific initiatives while taking our time to hire and onboard great people. We have the option to scale down the amount of hours from Open Work Labs as needed.

**[Jonathan Schwartz](https://github.com/schwartz10)** will be our point person and will lead the development of the *Facilitating Smart Contract Based IPFS Pinning*, *Expanding Social*, and *Making Aragon More Inclusive* initiatives. Jonathan has been working with us full time on AGP-19 and has made significant contributions to Open Enterprise, aragon.js, and the Aragon client. He led the [conversations around IPFS pinning](https://forum.aragon.org/t/aragon-network-ipfs-pinning/824) and the development of Aragon profiles and discussions. 

We believe there are great benefits with working as separate teams on shared initiatives and distributing technical leadership. As an added bonus, Open Work Labs will be providing training and interview assistance for our new hires as we transition all of our work in-house.
