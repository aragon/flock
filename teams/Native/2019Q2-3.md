## **Summary**

[Native](https://nativeproject.one/) is building a financial ecosystem for a collaborative world. We provide tools and infrastructure for community-based organizations to incentivize their members, scale, and realize their value in ways not possible through the traditional financial economy.

Since its inception, Native has intended to use Aragon as a backend for each of its communities by leveraging the modular implementations that Aragon provides in the form of Templates and Apps.

This provides a unique opportunity for cross-pollination between the two networks, where Native will contribute to arApps that will be useful within the greater Aragon ecosystem, and Aragon will power communities deployed on Native.

## **Initiatives**

### **I01 - Continuous Organization Model**

#### **Overview**

This initiative is focused on creating an economic model for continuous organizations within Aragon. The Economic Model is designed so that this type of organization is incentivized to collaborate rather than compete, as well as have a continuous funding mechanism. Additionally, this model creates a new way for organizations to enable instant liquidity for their tokens.

#### **2SAAM Token Model**

"**2 S**ends **A**nd **A M**int"

The goal is to integrate a new economic model as an option for Aragon organizations that enables more accurate pricing of a token by backing it with a reserve and creates a continuous fundraising mechanism for an organization. 

2SAAM has three integral functions that, when combined, make a unique type of tokenomic model. These functions regulate the value of an organization’s token, which fluctuates when users join and leave the organization.

1. Deposits are partially **sent** into a reserve denominated in a chosen base token - which could be NTV, ANT, or any other token type currently on the Ethereum network - to facilitate one aspect of accurate token pricing. This is essentially a bonding curve for the organization.

2. The remaining deposit is **sent** into an operating fund for the organization.

3. In turn for a deposit, a bonding curve determines the correct number of organization tokens to **mint** and send to the depositor.

This model creates a uniform valuation mechanism across all organizations using this model. Additionally, 2SAAM considers how revenues generated by an organization’s efforts are cycled back into the organization and revalued accordingly. Any revenue that is earned can be split between the reserve and community fund at the organization’s chosen split ratio.

Another function of this token type is that it can be functionally used as a currency in addition to being staked into an organization.

#### **Modular Reserve Composition**

Each organization determines what the optimal reserve currency is for their organization. Our arApp enables each organization to choose either an individual token or token set to act as their reserve.

Choosing a base token for a subset of connected organizations creates a network effect so that when one organization grows, it benefits all of the others using the same reserve composition, which can be simply called a "network effect".

#### **Deliverables**

* Implement ERC-1671 for bonded fungible tokens 

* arApp to administer Continuous Organizations

### **I02 - Staking for Membership**

#### **Overview**

When building a continuous organization there is a need to determine how many organization tokens each member will need to join. The purpose of this initiative is to extend the possibilities of leveraging the staked tokens in the form of a membership registry.

#### **Member Registry**

A member registry is deployed when a continuous organization type is chosen. The registry serves multiple functions, including enabling whitelist/blacklist and the ability to unstake from an organization at any time.

The registry dashboard provides a streamlined interface - supplementary to the ACL - for managing various classes of memberships. This allows members to perform different actions within the organization.

#### **Whitelist/Blacklist**

A whitelist function within a registry enables anyone to own tokens, but still limits who is actually able to participate in governance decisions and who can complete tasks/bounties.

Blacklists enable organizations to kick someone out of the governance and operational aspects of an organization but let them keep their tokens to be used as currency.

#### **Deliverables**

* Membership Manager arApp

* Staking Registry Contracts

### **I03 - Community Templates and Action Recipes**

#### **Overview**

This initiative intends to create a process for any user who wants to start and operate an organization to have an effective process which gives them the highest possibility of success.

Community Templates enable organizations to deploy DAOs with a set of pre-selected governance, tokenomics, and community type variables. 

In addition to templates, Action Recipes provide a structure for implementing and growing the organization, following the path that previous organizations have used to achieve success.

#### **Templates**

Created for various community verticals, templates make it simple for anyone to deploy a DAO that is suited to execute the organization’s goals. 

When onboarding an organization, the user is stepped through a series of guided questions that set the parameters for the organization’s economic and governance models.

For example, an organization for an ecovillage would have a different structure than a music festival organization. 

The differences can first be looked at in the token economic level. The reserve ratio of a music festival would be much lower than an ecovillage as the festival has intensive capital needs, whereas the ecovillage’s goal is to build a stable local currency. From a governance perspective, the music festival could utilize a meritocratic voting system and the ecovillage could be more democratic.

#### **Action Recipes**

Action Recipes are a series of projects, tasks/bounties and proposals that are deployable to an organization’s task manager such as TPS, and are designed to achieve a specific goal.

For example, there could be a "create content" recipe that has tasks requesting that members write articles that explain why they like being in that organization and can earn tokens for doing so.

#### **Deliverables**

* Continuous organization template type

* Recipes arApp to search and deploy common recipes

* Series of five sample recipes

### **I04 - Organization Healthgrades and Valuations**

#### **Overview**

This initiative is to provide metrics that enable users to more clearly understand the activity levels within an organization, and how that activity correlates to its valuation. 

In a world where 40% (and increasing) of [internet traffic is "fake,"](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/how-much-of-the-internet-is-fake.html) it is important to have insight into the underlying KPIs of an organization to determine whether or not they are creating a false image of success.  

#### **Healthgrades**

The purpose of a healthgrade is to inform users whether or not an organization is in good enough health (or has an appropriate valuation in relation to its health) to join. 

Organization healthgrades are the first step to achieving a fully autonomous valuation algorithm for organizations. To begin, we have 4 KPIs to include in the healthgrade calculation for Aragon DAOs, which include voting, creating proposals, buying tokens and token movement.

Healthgrades are reference points to the overall activity within an organization and do not have any direct effect on the price or value of an asset.

#### **Valuations**

Once the healthgrades are created, refined, and agreed to be an effective calculation of an organization's value, Native will create an algorithm that takes the healthgrade of an organization, adds additional KPIs focused on value, and calculates a fair market value (FMV) for an organization at any time. 

While this number does not necessarily mean that the DAO will be valued at what the FMV states, it provides a more precise reference than a healthgrade and can be directly correlated with real asset price.

#### **Deliverable**

The deliverable for this initiative comes in two phases.  Phase one will be completed during this six month period. 

The phase one arApp is a dashboard that provides analytics through a TheGraph subgraph (deployed during community creation) and displays statistics which are used to determine an organization’s healthgrade based on the KPIs discussed above. This deliverable will not have any connections to the price of an organization token, but rather just provide a layer of insight for users seeking to join the right organizations. 

Phase two will begin to address more formal valuations for Aragon organizations.

### **I05 - Merit-Based Voting and Merit Manager**

#### **Overview**

This initiative is to begin integrating reputation into Aragon. Users generally earn reputation by either completing tasks or participating in proposals and surveys. Tasks may not always be in the context of Aragon and therefore are not "scorable" by Aragon.

We propose to develop a **Merit Manager** arApp that creates "reputation scores" based on each organization’s chosen sources. This enables the possibility of a **meritocratic voting system** for Aragon organizations.

#### **Merit Manager**

The **Merit Manager** arApp is a dashboard that enables users to track their own and other’s reputation scores. The backend of the application mints and burns non-transferable reputation tokens based on an organization’s chosen merit sources, and sends them to users. This creates an on-chain mechanism for reputation scoring and voting.

#### **Merit Sources**

A Merit Manager **source **tracks reputation from a specific source, and forwards that information to the Merit Manager, which ultimately calculates the user’s reputation.

Example sources include:

* Aragon Organization through TPS

* Reddit

* Gitcoin

* Medium

* Discourse

* Colony

#### **Merit Voting**

The **Merit Voting** arApp uses reputation scores generated by the Merit Manager to denote a user’s weight when voting on merit-based proposals, even if they are not a formal member of the organization.

#### **Deliverables**

There are three deliverables to this initiative:

* Merit Manager arApp

* Merit Manager sample source

* Merit Voting arApp
