  <h1 align="center">Aragon Flock Proposal: Frame</h1>
  <br>
</p>
<h4 align="center">We've crafted a focused proposal that covers our needs to continue development and support of Aragon related initiatives.</h4>
<br>

## 1. Summary

### Strategy
Frame plans to continue adding fundamental value to the Aragon ecosystem at the platform layer. We want to embark on deeper coordination within Aragon to provide support for any platform Aragon chooses to build on: desktop, mobile, Ethereum, Polkadot, IPFS, etc. We're looking forward to working with current and future Flock/Nest teams to fulfill their needs at this layer and to create a unified effort towards wider adoption. Frame becoming part of Flock gives Aragon the ability to create, iterate, improve and maintain a path for users to go from zero knowledge to participating in a DAO. We think this is an important step. **We’ve made it our mission to keep our proposal focused and will over-deliver on our initiatives. We think our vision for adding value to Aragon is compelling and thoughtful. We hope others see the impact we'll have if included in Flock.**

### Why Us?
As a small team, we're proud that we've been able to compete with much larger teams with greater resources. We're still the leader in hardware support and just released a platform for smart accounts where they can really start to grow and thrive. Soon we'll also be a leader in running truly decentralized apps, again pushing the ecosystem forward in meaningful ways.

We’re a team that has executed on our goals, **released mainnet software** and proven ourselves in this space. We're morally aligned with the Aragon vision and return more value to the ecosystem than we take from it. We feel it’s important, now more than ever, to scale up our efforts/contributions and have a larger impact on making the Aragon vision a reality and building value for the ecosystem.

### Working in the Aragon Community

We think Aragon is a fundamentally more efficient substrate to organize human effort. As a team driven by the acceleration of human innovation, we'll always support Aragon here. We believe making the Aragon vision a reality will lead to massive jumps in the quality of life for all humans.

### Aragon Smart Accounts

**Value** - Aragon smart accounts allow your DAO to interact with the whole decentralized web. We will keep improving the user experience and functionality of these accounts to make them more powerful and easier to use. This includes keeping up with new agent features like `safeExecute` and any yet-to-be implemented features. It also means supporting users, iterating on their feedback and creating helpful workflows to get them up and running quickly. **We're working hard to make Aragon smart accounts a first-class citizen in other ecosystems. We see lots of creative and powerful uses for smart accounts on the horizon!**

**Deliverables** - User testing, community feedback, simplify setup, recognize when Aragon Smart Account is accessing the DAO it represents. Create flows for users to go from zero knowledge to participating in DAOs.

**Background** - https://aragon.org/agent

### Aragon Desktop via ENS/IPFS

**Value** - In Frame v0.2 we've added the ability for users to create their own connections to Ethereum and IPFS with the flip of a switch. This means truly unstoppable access for any dapp using this infrastructure! In the coming months we will replace the need for Aragon Desktop with the ability to launch the Aragon client using this ENS/IPFS infrastructure. This will work on any platform Frame currently supports including Windows, which Aragon Desktop doesn't currently support.

**Deliverables** - Resolve Aragon client via ENS/IPFS using Frame's local connections. Keep the Aragon client up to date by monitoring ENS record. Give users the ability to launch Aragon directly from Frame using this infrastructure.

**Background** - https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-desktop, https://github.com/aragon/aragon-desktop

### Decentralized Notifications for Aragon DAOs

**Value** - DAOs function on participation and transparency. It becomes an issue if users aren't aware of their DAO's activity or that a vote is coming up. To solve these issues, we will enable members of a DAO to subscribe to notifications about their DAO's activity.

**Deliverables** - The ability to receive decentralized notifications for any DAO.

**Background** - We currently have a standalone PoC of this notification architecture working and we will soon be adding it to Frame.

### Aragon Onboarding

**Value** - For a non-crypto user, participating in DAOs isn't easy. With Frame joning Flock we can build a path from zero knowledge, directly to participating in DAOs. As we add Aragon integrations into Frame it will become important to guide users and teach them about this powerful functionality so they can get up to speed quickly and start participating in the Aragon ecosystem. **One important point on this, we shouldn’t think about this functionality for only single users. This will be a very important feature for bigger teams, communities and organizations that want to start using Aragon. Large groups will be able to send out a simple link to all members, allowing everyone to seamlessly get up and running using their DAO without any external support.**

**Deliverables** - Frame will bundle together the suite of Aragon integrations with great UX and helpful guides to take users from zero knowledge to participating in DAOs with no outside support.

### Radspec & ENS Integration

**Value** - Rather than seeing raw addresses and data, we will add valuable context to all actions by resolving user friendly ENS names and adding Radspec definitions. This provides users with a deeper understanding of their actions and will create a more seamless connection between Frame and the Aragon client.

**Deliverables** - ENS resolving for all addresses and Radspec definitions for all transactions.

**Background** - https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues/58

### Frame Mobile PoC to Support Aragon on Mobile

**Value** - We want to support Aragon on all of the platforms it chooses to build on. To do this, we've added the development of a mobile version of Frame (with account sync) to our roadmap.

**Deliverables** - A proof of concept will be created to show users the value of developing Frame on mobile and so we can start to source feedback from the community.
