# Summary
Vocdoni is an independent R&D team working towards better systems for verifiable voting. We are engineering a future in which privacy-preserving voting processes are routinely enacted without need for trust-bearing authorities. To this end, we envision a role for ourselves within the Aragon ecosystem. 

We intend the algorithms, systems, and software that we build to be a useful contribution toward making "violence in these cryptonetworks impossible by protecting users' privacy with cryptography." In particular, our aim is to provide the necessary tooling for the political will of network participants to translate outwardly into real political capital, without sacrificing privacy.

In concrete terms, our intent is to apply our research so that can Aragon DAOs can conduct voting processes that provably account for particular properties of their participants (age, location, or membership for example) - without revealing this data in the course of voting.

# Deliverables

## I01 - Zk-SNARK voting
The primary goal of this deliverable is an extensible, audited, and well-documented reference implentation of the Zk-SNARK based voting scheme described in the [Vocdoni architecture](http://vocdoni.io/docs/#/architecture/generali). 

### Milestones
#### Implementation
Q3 2019 - A full implementation of the voting scheme, including extensive quantification of system properties and performance tradeoffs.
#### Audit
Early Q4 2019 - A multi-party security audit of the system architecture, cryptographic primartives, and reference implementation.



## I02 - Linkable Ring Signature voting
The primary goal of this deliverable is an implenetation of the LRS voting variant as described in the Vocdoni [documentation](http://vocdoni.io/docs/#/architecture/process-overview?id=casting-a-vote-lrs), achieving the same system properties, assurance of correctness, and comprehensive documentation as Zk-SNARK voting.
### Milestones
#### Implementation
Q4 - A full implementation of the LRS variant, including extensive quantification of system properties and performance tradeoffs.



## I03 - Robust, cost-effective L2 Infrastructure
The primary goal of this deliverable is to produce software allowing any organization, indvidual or DAO that wishes to conduct verified voting to securely and easily deploy supporting L2 infrastructure. The scope of work is detailed in the Vocdoni [component documentation](http://vocdoni.io/docs/#/architecture/components). The purpose of this supporting infrastructure is to  offload computation and coordination effort from the EVM, thereby improving performance and reducing cost. This can be done is such a way that there is no loss of data integrity. In particular we are working on RPC gateways and relay nodes that coordinate activity accross themselves, the blockchain, and content-addressable storage.

### Milestones
#### Implementation
Early Q3 - Feature-complete implementation of the components outlined in the documentation. Limited release for testing and QA.  
#### Auditing
Late Q3 - Extensive software audit of all components, including burn-in testing and sizable bounties.
#### Performance Testing
Q4 - Further in-the-wild testing, obversvation and iteration on all components.
