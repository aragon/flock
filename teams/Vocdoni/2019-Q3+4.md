# Summary
Vocdoni is a global project that aims to provide a universal, anonymous and end-to-end verifiable voting platform.

Our aim is a trustless voting system that anyone can run, where anyone speak his/her voice and where everything can be audited. We are engineering the building blocks for a permissioness, private and censorship resistant democracy and we belive that our platform can lead to very nice synergies within an ecosystem like Aragon's.

We intend the algorithms, systems, and software that we build to be a useful contribution toward making "violence in these cryptonetworks impossible by protecting users' privacy with cryptography." In particular, our aim is to provide the necessary tooling for the political will of network participants to translate outwardly into real political capital, without sacrificing privacy.

In concrete terms, our intent is to apply our research so that can Aragon DAOs can conduct voting processes that provably account for particular properties of their participants (age, location, or membership for example) - without revealing this data in the course of voting.

# Deliverables

## I01 - Services
The goal of this work package is to create all of the services and supporting infrastructure necessary for organizations to conduct and scale voting processes.

### Components
#### Census Service
Application and API allowing organizations of all types to create and manage collections of user public keys. Census maintainers can set their own criteria for the inclusion of keys in any particular census.
#### Process Service
Application and API for organizations to create and manage voting processes. Gives vote organizers a simple way to formulate ballots and launch on-chain voting processes.
#### L2 Suite
Tool suite enabling easy, secure deployment of supporting L2 infrastructure. The purpose of this supporting infrastructure is to  offload computation and coordination effort from the EVM, thereby improving performance and reducing cost. This can be done is such a way that there is no loss of data integrity. Gives stakeholder organizations a way to deploy and scale gateways and relay nodes that coordinate activity accross themselves, mobile users, the blockchain, and content-addressable storage.

### Roadmap
#### Q3
##### July
* Alpha release of census service. User feedback and testing with stakeholder organizations.
##### August
* Alpha release of process service. Process testing and scalability evaluation.
##### September
* Alpha release of L2 Suite. Burn-in testing and performance optimaization.
#### Q4
##### October
* Beta release of census and process service. Feature complete and refined user flows.
##### November
* Beta Release of L2 Suite. Large-scale testing and failure-mode evaluation. Secure, high-availability packaging and release pipeline.
* Begin comprehensive security audit. 
##### December
* Complete external security audit of all components. Break-fix and user-requested enhancements.
* Wide release



## I02 - Applications
The goal of this work package is to create client applications for participating in voting processes.

### Components
#### Signature App
Mobile client application allowing users to digitally sign petitions.
#### LRS App
Mobile client application enabling users to cast anonymous votes using Linkable Ring Signatures.
#### Snark App
Mobile client application enabling users to cast anonymous votes using Zero-knowledge proofs.

### Roadmap
#### Q3
##### July
* Alpha release of signature app. User feedback and refinement of overall experience.
##### August
* Beta release of signature app. Feature complete and polished.
##### September
* Alpha release of LRS app. Feeback on vote UI.
#### Q4
##### October
* Alpha release of Snark app. Testing and tuning of voting performance.
##### November
* Beta release of LRS and Snark apps. Testing at scale.
* Begin comprehensive security audit.
##### December
* Complete external security audit of all components. Break-fix and user-requested enhancements.
