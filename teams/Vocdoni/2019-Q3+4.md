#Summary
Vocdoni is an independent R&D team working towards better systems for verifiable voting. We are engineering a future in which privacy-preserving voting processes are routinely enacted without need for trust-bearing authorities. To this end, we envision a role for ourselves within the Aragon ecosystem. 

We intend the algorithms, systems, and software that we build to be a useful contribution toward making "violence in these cryptonetworks impossible by protecting users' privacy with cryptography." In particular, our aim is to provide the necessary tooling for the political will of network participants to translate outwardly into real political capital, without sacrificing privacy.

In concrete terms, our intent is to apply our research so that can Aragon DAOs can conduct voting processes that provably account for particular properties of their participants (age or location, for example) - without revealing any further data.
